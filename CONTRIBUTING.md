## How Can I Contribute?

Budgetron is currently very specialized for my personal use, and so there are potentially many anachronisms that make it difficult or confusing to contribute. I will attempt to assist anyone wanting to contribute, but cannot make any promises.

Alternatively, reporting bugs is a helpful way to bring to my attention blind spots and missing features.
